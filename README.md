# InventoryManagement_SQL
During our undergraduate Database Management Systems course, my teammates and I developed an Inventory Management project to apply our skills in database creation, optimization, and management. This project focuses on inventory management, a critical function for industries aiming to maintain efficient operations and minimize costs. By leveraging SQL, we designed a comprehensive database system that monitors stock levels, and manages suppliers. Our project demonstrates our ability to apply data analytics techniques to enhance inventory control, and reduce both stockouts and surplus inventory, showcasing the vital role of database management in effective supply chain operations.
